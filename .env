TASK = 'Creating an interactive car game for one player involves several key components, such as the games objective, user interface, controls, and visual design. Here is how you might outline such a project: Game Objective: The player must navigate a vehicle through various tracks, avoiding obstacles and reaching checkpoints within a time limit to score points. Additional points are awarded for speed, style (like drifts or jumps), and collecting in-game items. Game Mechanics: Controls: Arrow keys for movement; up for acceleration, down for braking, left and right for steering. Power-ups: Speed boosts, time extenders, and shield protections are randomly available on the track. Levels: Increasing difficulty with more obstacles and tighter time limits.'
